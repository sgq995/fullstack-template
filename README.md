## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this monorepo, you'll see the following folders:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ www/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trpc/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Folders in the `apps` directory are considered the final projects, something the user will see at the end. The folders in the `packages` are the shared projects.

The template contains some preconfigured projects:

- `apps/api/` is a [fastify](https://fastify.dev/) project.
- `apps/www/` is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project.
- `packages/trpc` is the shared [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) definition.

Tubo is used as monorepo build system. When `pnpm dev` is executed, every change to the `api/main.ts` and any modification for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `www/src/pages/` will dispatch an update.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
